		/************************************************************************************
		* Real-Time alternative/solution - Long Polling using Naked JavaScript												*
		* Proposed as Real-Time alternative/solution @ Intelligent Hosting Pte Ltd			*
		* By Mr Hery Mid May 2018															*
		*																					*
		* Declaration by Mr Hery:															*
		* Below script achieve data real-time as we keep the connection connected even the	*
		* request has timeout. This method statisfy my desireness but not support for		*
		* media streaming etc.																*
		*																					*
		* This method has some problem as the script keep connect even after timeout,		*
		* the requested server will be has a big load on it's RAM Memory. But it maybe		*
		* because of my simple PHP script.													*
		*																					*
		* My suggestion base on my experience, Socket Development has a lot better even for	*
		* media streaming, file streaming, even real-time video streaming as it don't take	*
		* RAM Memory too much and not too load the server.									*
		*																					*
		* For real-time video call/conference, WebRTC has a great API that can achive these	*
		* purpose wisely. I lltry to put as much solution/alternative I could in my github.	*
